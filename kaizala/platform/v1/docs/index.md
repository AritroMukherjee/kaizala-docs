The Kaizala Developer Platform offers multiple ways to integrate and extend Kaizala to suit your organizational needs. With the developer preview, you can use Connectors 
to integrate Kaizala with your business processes and design custom Actions through the Kaizala Management Portal.

## Connectors

Kaizala Connectors enable 3rd party developers to integrate Kaizala into their business processes by providing the ability to perform a curated set of actions in Kaizala 
using REST based API calls. The scope of the API is for external systems to call the end-point and perform actions on-demand. That is, this will be a PULL model â€“ where 
individual endpoints need to be called to perform specific actions. The PUSH model where Kaizala platform can trigger actions is on the roadmap.

## Kaizala Actions

Kaizala Actions are basic 'units of work' that help users get work done within a conversation context inside Kaizala. Some of these Actions like Job, Survey, Poll, etc. are 
shipped out-of-the-box and provide scoped functionality. These Actions can be discovered within the Kaizala app and can be invoked in a conversation context from the Action 
Palette.
